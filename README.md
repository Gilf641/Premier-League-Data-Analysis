PREMIER LEAGUE DATA ANALYSIS
Top-Tier English Football League is often referred as The Premier League. Each season 20 teams contest in this League. It operates on the system of Promotion and Relegation.

Here I tried to analyse different significant attributes by season and team.
I've used Two CSV files, one with the match results of 4560 Premier League matches - 380 matches over 12 seasons from 2006/2007 to 2017/2018 and nother one about all the stats i.e wins, losses, goals, shots on target etc..
I have mainly used R for Data Analysis and Visualization.
