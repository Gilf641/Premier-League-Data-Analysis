# Premier-League-Data-Analysis
I tried to analyse different significant attributes by season and by team i.e Season Breakdown and Team Breakdown.
I've used Two CSV files one with  the results of 4560 Premier League matches - 380 matches over 12 seasons from 2006/2007 to 2017/2018 and nother one about all the stats i.e wins, losses, goals etc
